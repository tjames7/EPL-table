Recreating the EPL table in Pandas

For this project I wanted to recreate the EPL table using Pandas and a .CSV file. EPL is the English Premier League and it is England's top flight soccer league. The EPL table is the standings of all 20 teams that are in the league in order based on the amount of points they've accumulated over the season. The team with the most points at the end of the season is declared the champion.

I wanted to take a .CSV file that had the results of each match up to 1/31/21 and munge the data so that I was able to tally up the amount of points each team has acccumulated to create the EPL table.
